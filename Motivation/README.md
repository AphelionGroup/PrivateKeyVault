### What's In It For Us?  
Authoritarian rule, Civil war, Terrorism, and Mass migration of refugees are the problems that mass adoption of blockchain technology will solve. Unlike normal money, cryptocurrency does not reside in any particular country and is not controlled by any government. So if someone with cryptocurrency leaves one country for another, their money is already there waiting for them as long as they have their private key. These people are not refugees, rather they are welcome visitors. But if someone with regular money needs to leave their country, the money stays. These people are not welcome visitors, rather they are refugees and a terrible burden to other countries. So turning people into refugees is profitable for dictators and terrorists and it weakens the free countries where refugees go. Imagine if refugees could take their money with them. The loss of funds created by people leaving would cause the worst governments and terrorist states to collapse. For the rest, market forces would cause governments to change even before they become very bad.  

This stabilizing effect of cryptocurrency on governments can only work if everybody is using it but until people are satisfied that there is a safe way to store private keys, cryptocurrency will not become main stream.  

**Now we have a safe way to store cryptocurrency that is accessible to everyone with electricity and an Internet connection.**  
Let's get rid of dictators and terrorist.  
Let's eradicate civil war.  
Let's give every human being planet wide access to their money.  
Let's turn every human being into a welcome visitor so that they will never need to flee their own countries.  
Let's show everyone how to make and use [The PrivateKeyVault](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault#privatekeyvault---click-for-open-source-make-instructions)
