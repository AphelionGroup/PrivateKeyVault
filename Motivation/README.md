### What's The Problem We Are Solving?  
Authoritarian rule, Civil war, Terrorism, and Mass migration of refugees are the problems that mass adoption of blockchain technology will solve. Unlike normal money, cryptocurrency does not reside in any particular country and is not controlled by any government. So if someone with cryptocurrency leaves one country for another, their money is already there waiting for them as long as they have their private key. These people are not refugees, rather they are welcome visitors. But if someone with regular money needs to leave their country, the money stays. These people are not welcome visitors, rather they are refugees and a terrible burden to other countries. So turning people into refugees is profitable for dictators and terrorists and it weakens the free countries where the refugee's go. Imagine if refugees could take their money with them. The loss of funds created by people leaving would cause governments to stop what they are doing. Market forces would cause things to get better even before they get very bad. This is only one of the many advantages of cryptocurrency over regular currency. This stabilizing effect of cryptocurrency can only work if everybody is using it, but until people are satisfied that there is a safe way to store private keys, cryptocurrency will not become main stream and dictators and terrorist will continue to thrive.   

Now we have a safe way to store cryptocurrency that is accessable to everyone with electricity and some way of connecting to the Internet.
