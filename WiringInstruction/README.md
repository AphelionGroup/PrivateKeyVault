This is what the finished wiring job will look like.  
A wiring diagram will be given further below.

In this photo we see qty 16 standoffs which are threaded 2.5 mm screws and are 6 mm long.  
These standoffs are fastened to the lid with 2.5 mm screws which are 6 mm long.  
[The standoffs, screws, and other parts can be found in this kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3299)  
PrivateKeyVault has no finacial relationship with the vendor.  

Also shown is the switch mount fastened to the lid with part found in the kit linked above.  

Notice that four holes are left empty. The touch screen will be fastened there later.  

Also notice that the chemically welded tabs are facing up so that the lid is laying flat on the table.  
That will ensure that the standoffs and switch mount are inside the box when the lid is closed and latched.

In this photo we see all the parts except the touch screen are mounted.  
We can't mount the touch screen until all the soldering is done.  

The battery plugs into the side of the charger board when you are ready to energize the Vault.  

I didn't show it in the photo above, but I actually shortened the red and black battery cables by cutting a section of wire out of each and then soldering them back together.  
**Danger**  
**Don't cut the wires at the same time or you will short out the battery and cause a dangerous arc.**  
**Instead, cut one wire to shorten it and then solder it back together and heat shrink the wire to safely cover the solder joint.**  
**Then it will be safe to do the same with the other wire.**  

The reason I did this is because the raspberry pi is very sensitive to voltage drops and longer cables cause a larger voltage drop. For the same reason I used 22 gage wire for all the power and ground connections. 

Also, the AC power plugs into the top of the charger board when you are ready to charge the battery or power the Vault.
