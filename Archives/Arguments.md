* Type: Digital Wallet

    * Fishing Attacks,  
    * Remote control,  
    * Key loggers,

  * Articles on the subject:    

* Type: Hardware Wallet   
  * Description:   
    * Runs on a piece of hardware that you plug into your computer  
    * We are also seeing these built into some newer phones  
  * Examples:  
    * Nano Ledger  
    * Trezor  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * I think these are quite safe for moderate amounts of money.  
    * The main problem is that the private key is generated by the device which is a central point of attack. The end user has no absolute assurance that the algorithm used to generate the key can not be hacked and that the private key can not be predicted. So if some individual or government were to put a back door into the algorithm then everyone loses individual control of their accounts all at the same time. This is contray to the goal of decentralization. Individuals must have the right to generate their own private keys using a method known to be completely random such as flipping a coin. This is the method I use. Flipping a coin is one of many fully decentralized methods of generating a private key which are sure to be truly random. It works like this: Let heads represent a one and tails represent a zero. Four flips will produce one hexadecimal character of the key by converting binary to hexadecimal.  
      * Four tails in a row would be a zero  
      * Heads, heads, tails, tails would be a three.  
      * Heads, heads, heads, head, would be an "F"  
      * You get the idea.  
      * This takes a while to accomplish, no government or individual can put a back door into this method. If you use this method, no one can ever guess your private key. An attacker might still be able force you to hand it over, but he or she would never be able to guess it using a dictionary attack nor by guessing personal information about you.  
      * Only a decentralized method of generating a private key should be used for large amounts of money and the Nano Ledger does not permit you to generate your own private key using a method known to be truly random. The Nano Ledger and other devices which use a pseudo random algorithm to generate private keys are a central point of attack.  
    * The Nano Ledger can not be used by governments, corperations, institutional investors or fund managers where a large number of accounts must be managed in complicated ways or where very large amounts of money are at stake. While the nano does allow for multiple public addresses, they are all tied to a master private key. So if the pass phrase is compromised then all the accounts are accessible. Furthermore multiple accounts are hard to manage with only two buttons on the nano.  
    * [Click here to find out more about these limitations](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereumnoobies/comments/7hebj8/ledger_nano_s_multiple_eth_wallets/)  
    * How can we expect organizations, governments and corperations to use blockchain technology when there are is no widely available method to securely manage multiple accounts. The PrivateKeyVault is meant to clear this bottleneck and make blockchain technology accessable to organizations, governments, and corperations. Getting these entities on the a public blockchain is how we will make them transparent and accountable.  
    
* Type: Paper Wallet  
  * Description: Private key pairs stored on paper  
  * Examples:  
    * Receipts printed out on the Vault or from any instance of MyEtherWallet  
  * Vulnerability:   
    * Unencrypted   
    * Thermal paper will turn black if kept in a hot environment.  
  * Articles on the subject:  

* Type: Cold storage   
  * Description: Private key pairs stored under a mountain usually as paper wallets  
  * Examples:   
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Centrally located - Fat Target   
  * Articles on the subject:  

* Type: AirGapped Wallet  
  * Description: Runs on a computer that never connects to the Internet  
  * Example: PrivateKeyVault  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Tempest    
    * Cameras on the Operator  
    * Installing a bug on the device  
  * Advantages:  
    * All data moving in or out of the device stands for your inspection and approval before proceeding.  
    * No radios of any kind are installed in the device  
    * there are no exposed cable jacks for data transfer.  


### Various Things the Vault Can Do That the Ledger Can't


### Arguments Against the ledger

Against Keeping Keys With Brokers
Other people trust their private keys to the brokers they use to buy the currency. Broker's computers often get hacked as well, and sometimes the brokers just disappear taking the private keys with them. In some countries the government forces the brokers to turn over their customers private keys. For these reasons, many people are moving to take control of their own private keys.

Ethereum is a Bubble
Many people are worried that the rising value of Ethereum is a bubble. I don't think so. I think what we are seeing is people emptying out their bank accounts and buying cryptocurrency with the funds simply because it is a more productive way to work with money. When there is no more money in the banks, then the price will stop rising. Until then I think we will see the value of Ethereum go up.

I think it's like this:
Email is better than the post office for most correspondence so most correspondence is sent by email. We are not having an email bubble.
Cryptocurrency is better for most transactions then banking services. As people come to understand this and as problems are resolved, the banks will find much less use (like the post office) and cryptocurrency transactions will be used most often (like email).
