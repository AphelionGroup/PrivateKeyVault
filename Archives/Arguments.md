# Arguments and General information used to promote the PivateKeyVault  

### Types of Wallets and Access to Private Keys  
* Type: BlockChain Clients  
  * Description: Perform Mining  
  * Examples:  
    * Geth,  
    * Parity,  
   * Vulnerability:  
     * Remote control, Key loggers,  
     * Network monitoring for when an account gets unlocked,  
     * Bugs in Parity software cause loss of Ether  
   * Articles on the subject:  

* Type: Command Line Tools  
  * Description: Anything that runs at the command prompt or at the NodeJS Console  
  * Examples:  
    * Web3js 
    * Any library that is used to make or work with keypairs at the command line.  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Remote control, Key loggers,  
    * Network monitoring for when an account gets unlocked,  
    * Private keys retained in log files  
  * Articles on the subject:  

* Type: Digital Wallet  
  * Description: Runs on your computer  
  * Examples:  
    * MyEtherWallet  
    * Mist  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Fishing Attacks,  
    * Remote control,  
    * Key loggers,  
    * Network monitoring for when an account gets unlocked,  
  * Articles on the subject:    

* Type: Hardware Wallet  
  * Description: Runs on a piece of hardware that you plug into your computer  
  * Examples:  
    * Nano Ledger  
    * Trezor  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Saw one report where Trezor was hacked by analyzing signal leaked on the power trace.
    * The biggest vulnerability might be if someone finds the recovery phrase or if operator is observed using the device.
    * Don't know if they are vulnerable to keyloggers or not.
    * In anycase, I think these are quite safe for moderate amounts of money. The problem I think the present is that they can not be used by institutional investors or fund managers where multiple accounts must be managed in complicated ways. For this you really need a powerful airgapped computer. So in order to get meaningful acceptance from a very important part of the finacial community we need more than what can be provided by hardware wallets. The PrivateKeyVault is meant to clear this bottleneck.
  
* Type: Paper Wallet  
  * Description: Private key pairs stored on paper  
  * Examples:  
    * Receipts printed out on the Vault or from any instance of MyEtherWallet  
  * Vulnerability:   
    * Unencrypted   
    * Thermal paper will turn black if kept in a hot environment.  
  * Articles on the subject:  

* Type: Cold storage   
  * Description: Private key pairs stored under a mountain usually as paper wallets  
  * Examples:   
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Centrally located - Fat Target

* Type: AirGapped Wallet  
  * Description: Runs on a computer that never connects to the Internet  
  * Example: PrivateKeyVault  
  * Vulnerability:  
    * Tempest    
    * Cameras on the Operator  
    * Installing a bug on the device  
  * Advantages:  
    * All data moving in or out of the device stands for your inspection and approval before proceeding.  
    * No radios of any kind are installed in the device  
    * there are no exposed cable jacks for data transfer.  


### Various Things the Vault Can Do That the Ledger Can't


### Arguments Against the ledger

Against Keeping Keys With Brokers
Other people trust their private keys to the brokers they use to buy the currency. Broker's computers often get hacked as well, and sometimes the brokers just disappear taking the private keys with them. In some countries the government forces the brokers to turn over their customers private keys. For these reasons, many people are moving to take control of their own private keys.

Ethereum is a Bubble
Many people are worried that the rising value of Ethereum is a bubble. I don't think so. I think what we are seeing is people emptying out their bank accounts and buying cryptocurrency with the funds simply because it is a more productive way to work with money. When there is no more money in the banks, then the price will stop rising. Until then I think we will see the value of Ethereum go up.

I think it's like this:
Email is better than the post office for most correspondence so most correspondence is sent by email. We are not having an email bubble.
Cryptocurrency is better for most transactions then banking services. As people come to understand this and as problems are resolved, the banks will find much less use (like the post office) and cryptocurrency transactions will be used most often (like email).
